\paragraph{Notational concerns}
We will use $\C$ to indicate the current sweep line cycle. 
We will repeatedly only consider the path $\cpath$. In that case we will always order it from $\mrW$ to $\mrE$. 

We will let $\W$ denote a interior walk  \fxnote{have i defined this already}. Given such a walk of $k$ vertices we index it's nodes $w_1, \ldots, w_k$  in such a way that $w_1$ is closer to $W$ then $w_k$ is (and thus that $w_k$ is closer to $E$ then $w_1$ is). 

Then $w_1$ and $w_k$ indicate the two unique vertices of the walk that are also part of the cycle. We will then let $\restC{\W}$ denote the part of $\C\setminus {\mathrm{S}}$ that is between $w_1$ and $w_k$ (including). $\C_\W$ will denote the closed walk formed when we paste $\restC{W}$ and $\W$.

Since paths are a subclass of walks all of the above notation can also be used for a path $\P$. Note that the closed walk $\C_\P$ in this case will actually be a cycle.

\emph{nondistinct corner.}

\section{Outline}
We will show that there is a algorithm if there are no $4$ cycles.

If graph $G$ has non-distinct corners or cutvertices we treat them separately.


The main algorithm will recieve as input a extended graph $\ext G$ without non-distinct corners and no separating $4$ cycles and will return a regular edge labeling such that all red faces are $(1-\infty)$ using a sweepcycle approach inspired by \Fusy \fxnote{spelling Fusy and cite} \cite{F}.

We will start by creating a walk $W$. This walk may not be a valid path, it doesn't even have to be a path. During the algorithm we will make a number of moves that will turn this candidate walk into a valid path. In each move we shrink $C$ by employing a valid path and change the candidate walk.

One invariant we will always maintain is that the area bounded by $\C_\W$ will never have interior vertices. \fxnote{What is exactly the area bounded by a closed walk}.

\subsection{The initial candidate walk}
Let $v_i$ denote all the vertices of $\C \setminus \braces{\pW, \pS, \pE}$ in the order that they occur on $\cpath$.  That is $\cpath$ is given by $\mrW v_1 \ldots v_n \mrE$. 
As candidate walk we will start with $\pW$, we will then take the vertices adjacent to $v_1$ between $\pE$ and $v_2$ in clockwise order (exclusive), followed the vertices adjacent to $v_2$ between $v_1$ and $v_3$ in clockwise order and so further until we finally add the vertices adjacent to $v_n$ between $v_{n-1}$ and $\pE$ in clockwise order and finally we finish by adding $E$.

\begin{lemma}
After removing subsequent duplicates the collection $W$ described above is indeed a walk.
\end{lemma}

\fxnote{introduce a term for "edges subsequent to each other in clockwise order around $v$"}

\begin{proof}
To show that $W$ is a walk it's sufficient to show that every vertex is adjacent to the next vertex. Let us suppose that $w$ and $w'$ are two subsequent vertices in $W$, we will show that they are connected if $\braces{w, w'} \cap \braces{\pW, \pE} = \emptyset$ after that we will consider this edge case. There are then two main case for $w, w'$. Either $(a)$ $w$ and $w'$ are  vertices adjecent to some $v_i$ subsequent in clockwise order or $(b)$ $w$ was the last vertex adjecent to some $v_i$ and thus $w'$ is the first vertex adjacent to $v_{i+1}$.

The following two situations can also be seen in Figure \ref{fig:walkproof}.

	\label{fig:walkproof}
\end{figure}


In case $(a)$ we note that $v_i w$ and $v_i w'$ are edges next to each other in clockwise order around $v_i$. Since every interior face of $\ext G$ is a triangle $ww'$ must be an edge. We thus see that $w, w'$ are adjacent and not duplicates.

In case $(b)$ we note that $v_i w$ and $v_i v_{i+1}$ are edges subsequent in clockwise order, hence $wv_{i+1}$ is also an edge. Hence $w$ is the first vertex adjacent to $v_{i+1}$ after $v_i$ in clockwise order. Thus $w= w'$, they are duplicates and we will remove $w$.

Now for the edge cases: $\pW$ and $w_1$ are vertices adjacent to $v_1$ subsequent in clockwise order, and hence connected. $w_m$ and $\pE$ are vertices adjacent to $v_n$ subsequent in clockwise order and hence connected. 
\end{proof}


\subsection{Porperties the walk already satisfies}

\begin{lemma}
$\C_\W$ has no interior vertices.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
$\restC\W$ has no chords
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This follows directly from $\C$ having no chords.
\end{proof}

It is clear that both paths have interior vertices

\begin{lemma}
S3 is satisfied since the walk is from $\pW$ to $\pE$
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Moves}

The candidate walk can have two kinds of problems. It either is non-simple or it has chords.\fxnote{cf Kusters. Where there are also two problems for a proper boundary path} Otherwise it is a valid path.
