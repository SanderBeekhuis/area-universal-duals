1. Problem (15)
  1. **Layouts** Applications, Area ubiversal,  one-sided (5)
    * TODO not every graph is one-sided
  2. **Rec dual and extended graph** This does not yet fix a layout (4)
  2. **REL** Properties of rel, this fixes a layout (6)
    1. Conditions
    2. Do fix a layout
    3. Properties
       * Acycluic flows
       * no monocolored triangles
       * interior of 4-cycle
   3. **k-sided** Recall that not every graph is one-sided. Are they k-sided?
2. Results (10)
  1. Graphs containing any seperating 4-cycle can be âˆž-sided
  2. Even when only on the poles
3. Goal (5)
4. TODO conclusion slide


## NOTES
Showing that the Rinsma graph is not one-sided is quite a lot of work with case distinctions. It is also not necessary, because we show a âˆž-sided graph.
