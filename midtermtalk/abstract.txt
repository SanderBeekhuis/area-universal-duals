SETTING
A rectangular layout is a partition of a rectangle into a finite set of interior disjoint rectangles. The interior of this rectangle thus contains vertical and horizontal line segments, such a  segment is $1 if it can't be extended any further on either side. A rectangular layout is one-sided if every maximal segment is the side of a single rectangle.

The rectangular dual of a graph $G$ is a rectangular layout whose rectangles have the same adjacencies as the vertices of $G$. To make such a dual one usualy adds 4 corner vertices to $G$ to obtain an extended graph.

Some rectangular duals are better then others. For example area-universal rectangular duals have adjacencies that hold regardless of the areas we assign to each rectangle.

Eppstein et al. have shown that rectangular duals are area-universal exactly when they are one-sided.[1] They show one can compute such a rectangular dual with a FPT algorithm if it exists. Unfortunately not all graphs admit a one-sided dual, an example is given by Rinsma. [2]

WORK
Since not all graphs admit a one-sided rectangular dual we relax this condition slightly and consider psuedo one-sided rectangular duals. Where we enforce that every maximal segment is on the same side of $k$ adjacent rectangles, with $k$ some (hopefully) small constant.

We show that extended graphs containing a separating 4-cycle in general do not admit psuedo-onesided duals.

We conjecture that all extended graphs without any separating 4-cycle can be colored in a pseudo one-sided way. And will show our progress on this conjecture so far.
