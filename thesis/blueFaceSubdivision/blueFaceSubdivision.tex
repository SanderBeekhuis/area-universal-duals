\subsection{Blue face subdivision}
\thispagestyle{plain}
\label{ss:subdiv}
  At this point we have a vertically one-sided graph (due to Lemma \ref{lm:topfan:oneSidedREL}) without large topfans except for the locations provided in Lemma \ref{lm:topfan:remainingTopfans}.
  In this section we are going to recolor edges in blue faces to make all of them $d-1$-sided, while at the same time not recoloring so many edges above each other that we create a large red face.

  We would like to start at the bottommost face $F$. Due to Lemma~\ref{lm:top:order} we know that there is always a face whose whole top boundary path of borders faces that are not treated while no part of the bottom boundary path borders such faces.

  We now recolor some of the edges of this face if it is too large.
  We then mark the edges on the top boundary path of this face above the recolored edges as \emph{loaded}.
  We try to avoid flipping above these edges in future iterations of the algorithm.
  Then we continue with the next face in the creation order.

\mypar{Loads}
  As is mentioned above we mark some edges with so-called \emph{loads}, we refer to these edges as \emph{loaded} in the rest of the section.
  The exact use of these loaded edges becomes clear in the rest of this section.

  It is important to note that if we load any blue edge we regard any other blue edge sharing at least one vertex with this edge to be loaded as well.
  The occurrence of this phenomenon is called \emph{putting trough a load}.
  An example can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:subdiv:putTrougLoad} where we flipped the thick edge, and hence marked $uv$ as loaded and because of putting trough load also marked $uw$ as loaded.

  \end{figure}


\mypar{Step requirements}
  We flip edges in each face, taking into account loads on the bottom boundary path, such that:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We never load the two edges next to a split or merge vertex on the top boundary path.
    \item We never load two adjacent edges on the top boundary path.
  \end{enumerate}

  If we flip edges in line with the step requirements for every face then the following lemma holds for the bottom boundary path of yet untreated faces.

  \begin{lemma}
    \label{lm:}
    On the bottom boundary path of a face we never find two subsequent loaded edges. Even when we put trough loads on splits and merges.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    A single face would never load two subsequent edges. Hence, the only way to get two subsequent loaded edges is using different faces and thus splits and merges.
    However, due to never flipping the two edges next to a split or merge we neither get subsequent loaded edges in such a case.
  \end{proof}


\subsubsection{Faces without large topfans in the middle}
  \begin{lemma}
    \label{lm:subdiv:withoutTopfan}
    We can subdivide any blue face without large topfans into $d-1$-sided chunks while obeying the load rules above.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
  A worst case example is given in Figure~\ref{fig:subdiv:worstCaseWithTopFan}.
  Note that we can flip to the right edge above each edge in the bottom boundary path except if we would end up next to the merge.
  In that case we flip the left edge above this edge.

  \begin{figure}[b]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{blueFaceSubdivision/img/worstCaseWithTopFan}
    \caption{A worst case blue face. We do not flip any edge in this face.}
    \label{fig:subdiv:worstCaseWithTopFan}
  \end{figure}

  We look at the vertex on the bottom fence that is incident to the freshly flipped edge, or if we have not flipped an edge yet the vertex next to the split (and we denote it by $v$). The following are then the rules for flipping above the edges following $v$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We do not flip above the edges of the first topfan.
    \item We flip above the second edge if it is unloaded.
    \item Otherwise, we flip above the third edge.
    \item We never flip next to the merge.
  \end{enumerate}

  When flipping above an edge, we always flip the right edge above that edge. Unless we are on the edge next to the merge, because then we flip the left edge above that edge.

  The first edge give us the required separation of loaded edges along the top boundary path. The other items make sure we obey the other rules.

  The worst case is given by a large topfan at the start and  a combination of the last two items. We would in that case want to flip above the second-to-last edge of the bottom boundary path. But we do not because the next edge is incident to the merge vertex. This gives at worst a topfan and  two more edges along the bottom boundary path and hence a $ d - 3 +2 = d -1$-sided face.
  \end{proof}

  See Figure~\ref{fig:subdiv:sampleExecution} for a sample execution of the algorithm described in Lemma \ref{lm:subdiv:withoutTopfan}.

  \begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{blueFaceSubdivision/img/sampleExecution}
    \caption{Sample execution of the algorithm.}
    \label{fig:subdiv:sampleExecution}
  \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Face encountering a larger topfan}
  If we have a large topfan in the middle of the face then above the left outer edge of this topfan we can not have another topfan that failed to flip its left outer edges due to Lemma \ref{lm:zflip:NoTwoSplitsAboveEachOtherVertOnesided}.
  This means we can use the following rule: we flip the first edge of a topfan even above a loaded edge.
  We call such flip a \emph{forced} flip.

  We can not have two such forced flips above each other because that would give a situation as in Figure~\ref{fig:subdiv:forcedFlips}.
  However, that would mean the fan with fanhandle $u$ must be the handle of a topfan that failed its flip and hence $v$ must have been a split vertex. But then by Lemma \ref{lm:zflip:NoTwoSplitsAboveEachOtherVertOnesided} $w$ can not be the handle of a large topfan.

  \begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{blueFaceSubdivision/img/forcedFlips.pdf}
    \caption{Two forced flips above each other.}
    \label{fig:subdiv:forcedFlips}
  \end{figure}

  Since we do not allow a flip above a load (whether it was forced or not) this means that the worst thing that can happen is an ordinary flip followed by a \emph{forced} flip. These two flips can not be followed by any other flip. Hence, the worst case only makes chains of at most $2$ blue $Z$'s, that is, a blue path of length $5$.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
  This concludes the last step of the algorithm.
  Now all the steps in the algorithm are done all that is left is to show that we indeed generated a $d-1$-sided regular edge labeling.
  \begin{lemma}
    \label{lm:subdiv:2chaindedZ}
    Two blue flips above each other give at worst a red $d-1$-sided face
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    With a \emph{blue fan} we mean a vertex that has multiple incoming or outgoing blue edges on the interior of this red face.
    The two blue flips above each other give a blue path $\P$ of length $5$ inside a red face.

    Before creating the $Z$'s in this section, the regular edge labeling was vertically one-sided.
    That is, before recoloring the two edges in this section there were no paths of length $3$ inside the face.
    This also implies that any $Z$ we now create can have at most one blue fan on the top and one blue fan on the bottom, otherwise we would already have had a $3$-path.

    So for two $Z$'s we have at most three blue fans.
    Hence, on one side we have at most one of these.
    Then the boundary path at this side of the face has at most $d-3 + 1 +1 =d-1$ vertices not counting the split and merge vertex of the red face.
  \end{proof}

    Then we can now prove Theorem \ref{th:dsided}.

  \begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{th:dsided} ]
    By construction all blue faces are $d-1$-sided. We have at most two blue flips above each other so red faces are $d-1$-sided by Lemma \ref{lm:subdiv:2chaindedZ}. Hence, we have a $d-1$-sided rectangular edge labeling of $\ext G$ corresponding to a $d$-sided rectangular dual of $\ext G$
  \end{proof}
