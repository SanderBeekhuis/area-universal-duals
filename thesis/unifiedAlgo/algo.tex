\paragraph{part 1}

Kant and He \cite{Kant1997} were the first to design algorithms that determine a regular edge labeling.

Fusy \cite{Fusy2006} recently developed a different algorithm computing a specific regular edge labeling using a method shrinking a sweepcycle while coloring the outside in accordance with a regular edge labeling.\footnote{The specific regular edge labeling Fusy obtained was the minimal element of the distributive lattice of regular edge labellings.}

All algorithms in this section will have the same core (based on \cite{Fusy2006}). Consisting of shrinking a sweepcycle by so called \emph{valid} paths.\footnote{In Fusy's work he calls these \emph{eligible paths}} But will differ in which valid paths they choose (if there are multiple).

\paragraph{part 2}

We will assume the entire graph has no separating 3 or 4 cycles. Furthermore we need that we don't have any nontrivial separating 5-cycles.  We will show that in this case ...

The lack of nontrivial separating 5-cycle leads to always escapable 3-chords (not yet used) and also the impossibility of two trouble edges being in the same red face.

\fxwarning{Do we need this ban of nontrival 5-cycles? -predraft 2}

The algorithm will consist of two phases

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find a \emph{vertically} 1-sided layout with additional properties
  \item Do additional post-processing steps to make this layout $k$-sided.
\end{enumerate}
