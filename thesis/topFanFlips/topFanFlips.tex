\section{Top Fan flips}
\thispagestyle{plain}
\label{s:fanflip}

The second stage of the algorithm will consist of flipping most large topfans. The first stage of the algorithm finished by computing a vertically one-sided \rel (Lemma's \ref{lm:sweep:REL} and \ref{lm:sweep:vertOnsided}) that never has a split next to a topfan handle along the rightmost edge of the split (Lemma \ref{lm:sweep:NoTwoSplitsAboveEachOtherVertOnesided}).

Using some local recoloring (\emph{flips}) on the topfans we will maintain a onesided REL (Lemma \ref{lm:topfan:oneSidedREL}) and make sure that large topfans only occur in very specific situations (Lemma \ref{lm:topfan:remainingTopfans}).

Our flips differ depending on whether we we encounter a split and or merge in the bottom boundary path. Refer to Figure \ref{fig:fanflip:fanflips} for the different kinds of topfanflips.

%\fxnote{We could make structure of the fence below the topfan more explicit. But we do not really need this}

We consider all faces we have in order from first created to last created.

\mypar{Flipping topfans}
A topfan is above a number of edges of the bottom fence of the face containing the topfan. These edges are the rim of the fan.

We flip the topfan along the rim starting at the first vertex and ending at the the vertex \textbf{before} the first split or $\pS$ adjacent vertex or the vertex \textbf{before} the last vertex. This can imply that we do not flip any edges (in the case that the first vertex is a split vertex or $\pS$-adjecent).


For the first vertex $v_1$ we recolor the adjacent outer edge of the topfan. For subsequent vertices $v_i$ we recolor the rim edge between this vertex and the previous vertex $v_{i-1}$ red and we recolor the edges adjacent to this edge in the rotation at $v_i$ blue (if they weren't already blue).

If we stop flipping before a merge vertex $v_{i+1}$ we flip and additional edge $v_i v_{i+1}$ along the rim.

Examples of this procedure are given in the following paragraph.


\mypar{Examples}
If the rim has no merges or splits we execute the topfanflip depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fanflip:regular}. We color all but the rightmost fan edge blue, color all but the rightmost rim edge red. And color the left sides of all topfans below this topfan in the face below the current face blue.

If the rim consists of only merges we easily adept a topfanflip to this situation. We simply do not flip the edge merging in as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fanflip:merge}.

A special case is given by a merge on the last vertex on the bottom edges of the top fan. In that case we flip all rim edges (even the last one) to prevent a blue $Z$ from forming. See figure \ref{fig:fanflip:mergeLastVertex}.

Splits are more difficult to handle. We are unfortunately unable to keep flipping once we hit a split hence we stop before we get that far. See Figure \ref{fig:fanflip:split}. It this happens on the first vertex we do not flip at all, see Figure \ref{fig:fanflip:splitFirstVertex}.

\mypar{The result}
Before the topfanflips we had a vertically one-sided REL. Afterwards we still have a vertically one-sided \rel as we will prove in Lemma \ref{lm:topfan:oneSidedREL}. Moreover we have no large top-fans except for some controlled cases as we will prove in Lemma \ref{lm:topfan:remainingTopfans}.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lm:topfan:oneSidedREL}
  If the graph was onesided before a topfanflip it is still onesided after such a flip in the regular and merge cases.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We invite the reader to take another look at Figure \ref{fig:fanflip:fanflips}.
  Let us first consider the regular case. Since the edge  $v_n w_m$ is red (otherwise we would have a merge) this change does not produce any blue $Z$'s.

  Let us also consider the other merge cases. Due to the clever recoloring these also do not lead to a merge.
  %However they can lead to a face starting with a large topfan. We will later see this is a controlled topfan.

  It is clear the split cases also do not produce a blue $Z$.

  Since any south-adjecnt fan is treated like a split fan we also do not create $Z$'s  in these cases.
  %But the topfans are again controlled. As we will see in the next section.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
  \label{lm:topfan:remainingTopfans}
  In the remaining faces every large topfan is in one of the following two situations.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item  This topfan is at the start of the face
    \item  This topfan is in the middle of the face and its left outer rim vertex is a split.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  All topfans are manipulated in such a way that they start a new face unless the left outer rim vertex is a split. In that case we do not flip at all.
\end{proof}
