\section{Algorithm}
Note that we shrink any chord or any polebound 2-chord as described in the previous section. \fxwarning{TODO ref}. We then have a vertical one-sided rel with all starts along the south border. We can thus liberally use topfan flips on all topfans.

This results in a layout that is still vertically one-sided but also without topfans. We first find the new order in the faces. Then we flip to make this graph $k$-sided. We start with the last face and we work our way up. Never flipping two edges next to each other (to keep space for the above face) or above each other (to prevent chains of Z's). We might be extra careful around the south edge of the graph.
