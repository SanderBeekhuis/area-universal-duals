\section{Future research question}

\paragraph{Things we can stil add to the thesis}
- A real proof that the algo by Fusy doesn't get stuck
- a vertically one-sided algo (just stop halfway the full algorithm)
- What's going on in a cycle? How does length and coloring influence the indside? (i.e. theorhy of counting forwards and backwards)

\paragraph{easy}
Show that a Regular edge labeling doesn't admit any directed cycles (and not only no monocolored directed cycles).

\paragraph{hard}
- A horizontally one-sided algo may provide more insight.
