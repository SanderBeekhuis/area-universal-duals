\section{ Conclusions and future work }

In this thesis we proved the following two theorems

\begin{enumerate}
  \item There is a family of graphs $G_k$ that for any $k \in \N$ has members that are not $k$-sided (Theorem \ref{fix:th:family}).
  \item Triangulations of the $k$-gon $G$ that have a corner assignment without separating 4-cycles are $d$-sided, where $d$ is the maximal degree of the vertices of $G$. (Theorem \ref{th:dsided})
\end{enumerate}

There are still many open questions in this research area. For example, one might hope show that all corner assignments without separating $4$-cycles are actually $2$-sided.

There also might be an algorithm that gives $d$-sided layouts for graphs with a separating $4$-cycle as this is not precluded by Theorem \ref{fix:th:family}.
