\section{Conclusions and future work}

In this thesis we proved the following two theorems

\begin{enumerate}
  \item There is a family of graphs $G_k$ that for any $k \in \N$ has members that are not $k$-sided (Theorem \ref{fix:th:family}).
  \item Triangulations of the $k$-gon $G$ that have a corner assignment without separating 4-cycles are $d-1$-sided, where $d$ is the maximal degree of the vertices of $G$. (Theorem \ref{th:dsided})
\end{enumerate}

There are still many open questions in this research area. For example, one might hope to show that all corner assignments without separating $4$-cycles are actually $2$-sided.
There also might be an algorithm that gives $d$-sided layouts for graphs with a separating $4$-cycle as this is not precluded by Theorem \ref{fix:th:family}.

We also wonder whether the second step in the algorithm, Flipping blue $Z$'s, is necessary.
We suspect that result of the sweepcycle algorithm is vertically one-sided.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would not have been able to write this thesis without my two supervisors Bettina Speckmann and Kevin Verbeek. They always provided suggestions and motivation when I was stuck and helped bring structure in the mess that this thesis first was. I also want to thank Jesper Nederlof for making this project possible by guaranteeing that this project is sufficiently mathematical.
Moreover, I want to thank Wouter Ligtenberg, Hans Beekhuis and Kaylee Cox for reading trough my thesis and finding many mistakes. Last but not least I would like to thank Kaylee, friends and family for being a outlet for my frustrations.
